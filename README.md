# ACO_single_depot
This is a simple ACO (Ant Colony Optimization) algorithm to solve a single depot VRP with multiple vehicles.

Cities and the depot are imported mannually in the code. Just change the coordinators, the number of agents(vehicles), traveling cost, alpha and beta to customize the code.

At the end, for each agent the suggested path is visualized as well as printed results at the run tool window.

Hope you find it helpful :)
